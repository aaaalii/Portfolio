        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>Hello, I'm a passionate and dedicated software engineer on a journey to transform ideas into digital
                experiences. With a strong foundation in computer science and a natural curiosity for emerging software
                technologies, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant and user-friendly solutions.

            <h3>Education:</h3>
            Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering, PUCIT 2024 <br>
            <h3>My Journey:</h3>
            My journey into the world of software engineering began with a simple curiosity for how computers worked.
            Over the
            years, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects, from creating registration systems
            and websites. Each project has been a stepping stone
            in my evolution as a developer.
